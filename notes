First Idea:
Create a Pokemon game that has a story line and the goal to 'catch 'em all' in a restricted area.

Pygame seems to be a good resource for creating a video game
Using a binary installer for pygame so it can be compiled in the background
Also installing pyObjC 1.4

After hours using pygame, I am not finding it as intuitive as VPython. I will now code my game in VPython and then transfer over to pygame 
if time allows.
